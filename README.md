## Lock\-Out


</div>

### Description

This will stop anyone from accessing your computer. Compile this into an exe and remember that the password is password - DO NOT forget. If you forget the password then there is no known way of getting back in. You have been WARNED!!! This works by: hiding your cursor so that the unauthorised doesn't know where it is, puts the cursor in the top left corner of the screen and makes it stay there, fools the system into thinking the screensaver is running therefore disabling Ctrl+Alt+Delete, Alt+Tab and the Windows Key. If you put in the password wrong 3 times the system is forcefully shutdown. There is no way of getting round this that I know of without having access to the system in the first place.
